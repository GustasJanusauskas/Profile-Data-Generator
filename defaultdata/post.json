But they know that as long as you\u0027re out there, they\u0027ll never be able to rest easy."},{"title":"\u00222070 Message\u0022","body":"I was sitting in my favorite coffee shop in New York City when a stranger sat down across from me and asked me to give a message to someone they would meet in 2070. I was a little taken aback at first, but then I realized that this must be a tradition among immortals and time travelers. I agreed to do it, and the stranger told me to give the message to a woman named Sarah. They said that Sarah would be a great leader and that she would change the world."},{"title":"Trapped in the Elevator","body":"I went for a cigarette break, but the elevator stopped working and I was trapped in it for 2 hours. As the doors finally opened, I walked out and saw a brand new lobby, people holding thin digital cards and big screen TV\u0027s. It was the year 2018. I couldn\u0027t believe it! I had been stuck in that elevator for 19 years!"},{"title":"The world was so bright and I was soblind. The light burned my eyes and I had to shut them tight. I tried to open them again but it was too painful. I was afraid to move, afraid to do anything that might make the pain worse. I just lay there, waiting for the pain to","body":"The first thing I noticed was the light. It was so bright that I had to squint to see anything. I looked around and saw that I was in some sort of enclosure. The walls were made of a strange material that I didn\u0027t recognize. I tried to touch it and found that it was warm to the touch. I pressed my hand against it and felt a pulse, like the heartbeat of the Earth. Suddenly, the door to my enclosure opened and a figure walked in.\n\nAt first I thought it was one of the gods. They were always coming to visit me, to check on me and see how I was doing. But this figure was different. He was taller than any of the gods and his skin was a deep green. He had no eyes, just two long slits down the sides of his head. He was wearing a robe made of the same strange material as the walls of my enclosure.\n\nThe figure came closer to me and I stepped back. I didn\u0027t know who this was, but I didn\u0027t like the way he was making me feel. He reached out and touched my cheek and I flinched away from him. His touch was cold and sent a shiver down my spine.\n\n\u0022Do not be afraid,\u0022 he said in a voice that was like the sound of wind blowing through the leaves of a tree. \u0022I am not here to harm you.\u0022\n\n\u0022Then who are you?\u0022 I asked, my voice trembling.\n\n\u0022I am the last of the Ancient Ones,\u0022 he said. \u0022I am here to offer you a choice.\u0022\n\n\u0022What choice?\u0022 I asked.\n\n\u0022You can either stay here and watch the Sun swallow the Earth, or you can come with me and start a new life on the other side of the galaxy.\u0022\n\nI thought about it for a moment. I didn\u0027t want to stay here and watch the world end. But I was scared of what was on the other side of the galaxy. I didn\u0027t know if I could trust this stranger.\n\n\u0022I\u0027ll go with you,\u0022 I said finally.\n\nThe stranger nodded and held out his hand. I hesitated for a moment, but then I took it. His hand was warm and comforting. I felt safe with him.\n\nHe led me out of my enclosure and into a spaceship. I looked back at the Earth one last time as we left. I knew I would never see it again, but I wasn\u0027t scared"},{"title":"The end is nigh as the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse ride through the towns and villages, spreading terror and destruction in their wake.
