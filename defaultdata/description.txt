Why do you think it is that there is such a conflict between the people who want freedom from a dictatorship and the people who want freedom from religion?\n\nThere is a conflict between the people who want freedom from a dictatorship and the people who want freedom from religion because they are two different things. People who want freedom from a dictatorship want to be able to live their lives without someone telling them what to do, while people who want freedom from religion want to be able to believe in whatever they want without someone telling them what to believe.
I love making costumes but they are never original I would love to have some originality to them.\n\nThere are a few ways that you can make your costumes more original.

I hate this and this and this, blah blah blah. I wish we had this and this and this!”. You get the picture. If you want your server to continue to grow, you need to give your players the opportunity to voice their opinions about the server. By simply creating a thread on the forums, or even a poll, you open up a huge door to get ideas from your players and use their experience to benefit the server. I guarantee that you’ll be surprised how creative players can be!\n\n\n\nNexus-Tk will also be hosting a series on how to develop a successful server. These are the first two guides.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Article Written by Arteryz]

Why do the rich and powerful always see the poor and the powerless as the ones profiting from a system that needs to be changed, but the rich and powerful by their own admission are the ones who profit most?"\n\n\n\nThere are a number of reasons for this. First, the rich and powerful have a vested interest in maintaining their position of power and privilege. They want to keep the status quo because it benefits them. Second, they are often ignorant of or indifferent to the plight of the poor and the powerless. They don't see how the system is rigged against them and they don't care. Finally, the rich and powerful are often able to use their influence and resources to control the narrative and blame the poor and the powerless for the problems of society.

I like the idea and implications of this—I want to find a way to make my own, or to encourage/help my students to play with, film transcripts in a similar fashion to how Yanyu Chen has worked with her interviews.\n\nI also like the idea that Chen has challenged the authenticity of the interview and interviewee through the transcribing and slighting changes Chen makes to the “official” transcription.\n\nChen’s work is also a great example of how the use of the subtitle track in YouTube can be used in a much more dynamic way than just translation or the “hard of hearing.” Here it serves as an extension of the visual image on the screen.\n\nChen’s work is also a great example of how the SubRip software can be used. It would be great if someone at Centre could write a tutorial on using SubRip/SubRipX.\n\nAdvertisements

I love it when people ask me things like, “What was one of your favorite classes?” or “What do you wish you had taken more classes in?”\n\nMy answer is almost always the same.\n\n“I wish I had taken more classes in art.”\n\nIt’s so true. I always loved art, but I never took advantage of the art classes that were available to me.\n\nAs an English major, I took a lot of classes that I enjoyed, but I wish I had taken more classes in art.

I love love love this Realtor! She is so supportive of all her clients for any and all steps in the housing market. She is very detail oriented, and because of that everything runs smoothly and quickly! I have used her for multiple transactions already and continue to call on her for each and every housing market transition! If anyone is looking for an agent in the entire state of Texas, she is the one to call and use!\n\nI have had an amazing experience from start to finish with Melissa Faircloth. I worked with Melissa on finding my first home. She answered all of my questions and educated me about the home buying process. She worked hard to help me find the perfect home for my family.

I love that ever since you started writing about the work you've done, people have come forward and shared their stories, like the one about the father and son who recently reconnected and the one about the wife who survived the husband's murder.\n\nI think people are more comfortable sharing their stories with me because I write a blog, and they don't feel like I'm really reporting on them. A lot of people feel like they need to tell their stories, and they don't necessarily want to go to the media to do it.\n\nWhat's been the biggest challenge you've faced so far as a reporter?\n\nThe biggest challenge I've faced is the emotional toll it can take. It's hard to see people going through so much hardship, and it can be hard to keep going when you feel like you can never make a real difference.\n\nWhat advice would you give other aspiring reporters?\n\nThe best advice I can give is to keep going. Don't be discouraged if you don't get the story you want right away, or if you don't get the recognition you feel you deserve.\n\nKeep writing, keep learning, and keep fighting for the stories that need to be told.

I am in my early 30s and have been in my wife for a few years. I am sexually attracted to her and enjoy our sex life. However, I am also attracted to other women. I have never cheated on my wife, but I have fantasized about doing so. I have also looked at pornography that features other women. I'm not sure what to do about these feelings.\n\nThere are a few things that you can do in order to work through these feelings. First, you can talk to your wife about them. This can be a difficult conversation to have, but it can be helpful in understanding your feelings and working through them together. Additionally, you can try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and your sex life. This can help you to feel more satisfied and to reduce the temptation to act on your fantasies. Finally, you can seek out counseling or therapy, which can provide you with additional support and guidance.

Why do something you are not sure is going to work?\n\nThere are many reasons why people might choose to do something even though they are not sure it is going to work.

I don't have to spend money on things like gas or food when I'm at home.

I am new to Python. I'm trying to save the output of a loop, but the only way i have found to do this is to save all integers in an array and print the array at the end and then save it. I have been looking into xlrd/xlwt and writing .csv files, but i can't seem to do either properly. I don't necessarily want to save the entire loop, but rather save a line at a time. I have tried the following method and it does not work, it only saves the last line of the loop.\n<code>dfn = open('df.csv','w')\n    with open('df.csv', 'a', newline='') as csvfile:\n        writer = csv.writer(csvfile)\n        writer.writerow([Word, Max_N, Total_Freq, Max_Freq, Iteration, Word_Count, Mapped_Freq])\n        writer.writerow([' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' '])\n    dfn.close()\n</code>\nI hope i have been clear, I'd like to proffer over a solution so i can learn as i go

I am looking for a suggestion for a solution for a "strange" problem.\nWe are using a StreamServe document management system (see streamserve.com) and it uses a relational database.  When a customer views/edits a document, StreamServe looks up the record in the database, makes copies of the various graphic files (if there are any) and then provides a copy of the document to the customer.  When the customer is done, they save the document and StreamServe updates the database record and inserts new records for the graphic files that have been added.\nWhat we are looking for is a performance boost.  If a customer makes 100 updates to a document, StreamServe is looking up the record and making copies of the same graphic 100 times.  We are thinking of caching the first copy of the graphic so that each of the 100 updates doesn't require looking up the record and making copies of the graphic.  But I don't know if we can cache the sql query and the graphic in our C# .net application.  What I want is for an application programmer to use the StreamServe classes, "as is", so that if we ever change StreamServe, those classes aren't broken.  We
Why do you take time to smell roses?\n\nRoses have a pleasant smell, and taking time to smell them can be a way to relax and enjoy the moment.

I like the way you make it sound like it's all my idea."\n\n"It is." She let out a grinding noise. "Why is it hard to say I love you out loud?"\n\n"I don't know." He wrapped an arm around her and pulled her close. His eyes were hard on her. "I love you, Eve."\n\n"I love you too." She felt herself blush, and she pressed her lips to his. "I don't know how to make it sound better, but I love you."\n\n"That's all that matters." He kissed her again. "That's all that ever mattered."\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 25\n\n\nEve\n\n\n\n\n\nEve was pulled from sleep by the sound of voices in the other room. She blinked her eyes open and looked at the clock on her bedside table. It was seven in the morning.\n\nShe sat up and tried to listen to the voices, but she couldn't make out what they were saying. It sounded like Grace and Luke, but that couldn't be right. Grace and Luke weren't supposed to be back from their honeymoon for another week.\n\nEve pulled the covers off of her and got out of bed.
Why do we need to measure\n\nThere are many reasons why measurement is important. For example, measurement is essential in order to:\n\n-Compare things (e.g. to see which is larger, heavier, etc.)\n\n-Estimate quantities (e.g. how much paint is needed to cover a wall)\n\n-Determine the properties of things (e.g. the density of a material)\n\n-Perform calculations (e.g. to work out the area of a room)\n\n-Communicate information (e.g. giving someone your height in centimetres)
I am new to sqlite, \nI am trying to create a table which will store school level, his subjects and marks obtained. A school can have multiple subjects and multiple marks for each subjects.\n<code>CREATE TABLE Scores (\nID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\nName TEXT,\nDOB TEXT,\nScores TEXT\n);\n</code>\nIf I use this, how will I store multiple marks and subjects?\n\n\nA:\n\nWithout more details, it is hard to give a precise answer but as a general rule if you are using more than one table, you should use foreign keys to relationship an ID from one table to another.\nI would suggest something like this structure:\n<code>CREATE TABLE Student (\n    ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    Name TEXT,\n    DOB TEXT\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE Subject (\n    ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    Name TEXT\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE StudentSubject (\n    ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    StudentID INTEGER,\n    SubjectID INT

I love everything about working at the co-op! I am passionate about our mission, and the people I work with. I've learned about so much great local food and products, and enjoy working with our community & members.\n\nWhat does local mean to you?\n\nI was born and raised in South Dakota, and have lived in Wisconsin for 4 years. When I think about "local" I think about the food I grew up with and the farmers I knew. I also think about the people in our community, who are winemakers, cheese makers, & farmers. Local is about building relationships with people who are working to make their communities a better place.
I like having a little more control over what I'm doing. I think it means more to me when it's completely mine."\n\n"Can you still work with people? Collaborate?"\n\n"Of course. But it's different. It's like I'm in control and they're reacting to what I want. It's not always the same, but it's what works for me."\n\n"I see."\n\nWe were both silent for a moment and I could tell he was thinking about what I'd said. "It makes sense, actually. I can see how that would work for you."\n\n"Good."\n\n"Is there anything else you want to tell me?"\n\nI shook my head. "No, I think that's it."\n\n"Okay." He stood up and held out his hand to me. "Thank you for your honesty."\n\nI shook his hand and then followed him out of the room.\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\nI was in my office, working on a new project, when my assistant came in.\n\n"Mr. Stone is here to see you," she said.\n\nI frowned. I wasn't expecting him. "Okay, send him in."\n\n
I hate the way my father and my grandfather subscribe to the 1950s philosophy on gender roles: men wear the pants in the family and are the primary breadwinners while women wear skirts and take care of the children.\n\nI grew up in a family where my father and grandfather subscribed to the 1950s philosophy on gender roles: men wore the pants in the family and were the primary breadwinners while women wore skirts and took care of the children. I often felt like I was living in a time warp where women's rights and equality were concerned. As an adult, I've made a conscious effort to create a more balanced and egalitarian relationship with my husband.
I like it too," Imogen said. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, and Francis knew she was trying to avoid his eyes. "The armchair has great bones," she said, "and with a few repairs, it will look great."\n\n"I like your confidence," he said.\n\n"I like your armchair."\n\n"Well, it really looks like a great piece. Have you checked the upholstery yet?"\n\nImogen nodded. "It's well-made," she said. "The fabric is worn and faded, but it's original and it's structurally sound."\n\n"Excellent."\n\n"It's a great piece," she said. "I'm excited to work on it."\n\n"And you're a great upholsterer," he said. "I'm excited to see what you'll do with it."\n\nThey looked at each other, and Francis was about to say something when his phone rang. He checked the caller ID, but didn't recognize the number.\n\n"Sorry," he said, "I have to get this."\n\n"No problem."\n\nHe answered the phone and put it to his ear. "What's up?"\n
I love you” as a declaration if you want to say it. But, store it in your heart as a prayer, an attitude, a wish, an intention. Unless you say it in the context of a free exchange in which the other person is free to respond or not respond, it’s an accusation instead.\n\n“I love you,” I tell my wife, although she didn’t ask for it. Seems a little presumptuous and a lot of pressure, doesn’t it? Of course, if her innate need for love and affirmation is greater than that, maybe it would be better just not to say anything at all.\n\nIf you genuinely love others without expecting any reply, then they will naturally respond. And you are moving them towards their wholeness. People can never live up to our expectations. We often end up feeling disappointed, betrayed and angry at them. And all the time the person feels inadequate and unworthy, greatly exacerbating the need that you were trying to address with your declaration in the first place.\n\nOur motivations are informed by our values. In a world where money and possessions are extremely valued and in fairly short supply, it’s natural to feel selfish and protective if someone
Why do you never use the word\n\nI don't know.
I like the natural pattern of the wood more than the finish itself," said Linsey, looking around her own dining room with its medley of built-ins.\n\n\n\nWood grain patterns are not the only aspect of "natural finishing," however. Gilding is still widely used and can look just as natural and well-integrated into the design as stain.\n\n\n\n"It really depends on the style you want to accomplish with the space," said Linsey. "Gilding can be done to give the illusion of material that's much more expensive than it actually is. I've seen weathered wood stained to look like it's an antique."\n\n\n\nGilding is used to add dimension and highlight architectural details such as molding, doorways and mantels. In fact, Linsey is currently having the back piece to a fireplace in one of the houses she is restoring gilded for this exact reason.\n\n\n\n"We had the back piece cleaned, so it's now all the same golden color, but we wanted it to stand out from the rest of the fireplace," said Linsey. "It also just looks really pretty."\n\n\n\nGilding used to be done in earnest with real gold leaf. But "gold leaf

I am not 100% positive, but I think the verb "to tell" should be used with the subject in the 1st person singular here.\nIn general, the verb "to tell" wouldn't have a negative connotation if the subject is "I", even if the subject matter were sensitive or embarrassing.  If, however, a person were to tell others about his/her sensitive or embarrassing experiences, then the person may be perceived as bragging or gossiping.\nAnother consideration, which may be more important, is that this sentence seems to imply "I am not telling anyone" (at least, that's my interpretation).  The speaker may actually be telling some people and not others and the speaker sees this as an insignificant distinction.\n
Why do you want me to come with you?"\n\nBecause I don't want to go alone.

'You are the best mother anyone could have.'\n\n'And what of you?' the Queen asked, gently pushing him away from her, a concerned look on her face. 'You have changed, my son. I can sense it in you. You are tired, sad and angry, and I can tell you are hiding something from me.'\n\n'It is nothing, Mother, I assure you. I am merely tired, and angry at the way my life has turned out.'\n\n'Turned out?' The Queen was confused. 'Whatever do you mean? You are the ruler of the Fargits, and shall be King when I no longer rule.'\n\n'Yes, Mother, I know.' Fargit sighed. 'But if you knew what I went through on my travels, you might not be so quick to hand the crown to me. My time as a Captain in the Auvergne Army changed me, it really did. I saw death and violence which I would never have thought possible. I saw people die in

I am just starting to learn R. I have some experience with R-Studio but I am not sure what is going on. I have managed to extract the time and minutes to the hour of dataset but when I add a new variable of seconds, I expected it to also display the seconds to the hour but instead it only displays seconds to the minute.

I like people a lot,” Kravitz said. “I played a lot of places with a lot of people. I’ve matured a lot over the years. I don’t take any of this too seriously. It’s rock and roll, it’s supposed to be fun. I enjoy playing with people who enjoy playing. I’ve met some great musicians. I’ve tried to surround myself with good musicians throughout the years.”\n\nHe added: “I’m just a musical person. I’ve been doing it all my life and I plan to do it for the rest of my life. It’s just a part of me.”\n\nBut looking back, Kravitz is not sure it would have happened the same way if he was from this generation.\n\n“With social media it’s different,” he said. “I started out around the time the Internet was just coming in. I was the old school, a guy from a different era. The era of the Internet is different. I think people feel a little entitled these days and you have to stay current.\n\n“Now if you’

I would buy a new bike in this size without the disc brakes but I'm daring like that. :D\n\n\n\nI actually had a white one that I bought and sold it cuz they didn't fit. Theoretically they should fit better than on a Klein Attitude cuz it's a hardtail with less travel. But I wasn't happy with it in that respect.\n\n\n\nI'll look at it, but I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to buy it till Thursday morning.
I like to think of the human body as a machine, with lots of different functioning parts. I like to think of osteoarthritis as a problem with one of those parts - in this case, the joints.\n\nThe joints are where two bones come together, and they are held together by a tough, fibrous tissue called cartilage. The cartilage acts as a buffer between the bones, absorbing shock and allowing the joints to move smoothly.\n\nOsteoarthritis is a condition in which the cartilage breaks down, and the bones start to rub together. This can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints.\n\nThere is no cure for osteoarthritis, but there are treatments that can help to relieve the symptoms. These include painkillers, anti-inflammatory drugs, and exercise.\n\nIn severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or replace the damaged joints.
I am new to REACTJS. I am trying to add a <code>select</code> element to my code. The items in the <code>select</code> are fetched dynamically from the server.

I am so proud of her!”\n\nThe tone from those who follow and comment on Sarah’s blog has gone from that of an ostracized, rebellious kid to one of acceptance and support. Her peers, who might be the closest thing she has to family, applaud her for speaking out. Sarah has found a way to tap into a supportive network of her peers who are united by a shared experience of being isolated and misunderstood, both in and out of their home.\n\nQuestions and Observation\n\nSometimes we see youth rebel. We see them when they dress differently, down to their look, the music they listen to and the music they write. We see them when they use words we don’t understand. We see them when they speak their minds, write their truth and show their feelings and pain. Sometimes our response is to ostracize, ignore, dismiss and dismiss them.\n\nWhen we react in panic to youth behavior, we tend to blame anything and everything we can think of, ourselves included. When we blame ourselves and don’t know how to help, we end up passing the buck to any person or institution that “should” be helping them. I’ve seen it happen too many times.
I am being curt, I know) and most importantly, don’t be afraid to ask questions, whether it’s to the writers, or to the sites you read. If there’s something you don’t know, or think your knowledge isn’t up to par, then ask! Not only will the writers be okay with it, but I find that most readers are in the dark about a lot, and will benefit from hopping on your train and giving you both a helping hand.\n\nWhat should I feel bad about?\n\nYou should feel bad about writing, about the work you pour into something you love, about being honest with your audience and not catering to the mob, about being forced to give up something you love, about the environment you were born and raised into, about the people you care about, about being in this situation in the first place.\n\nYou should feel bad about finding yourself in a position you never asked to be in, and you should feel bad about being pushed around by people who claim to love and care about you, when all they really want is for you to shut up and do what they say.\n\nYou should feel bad, but don’t.\n\nI
I hate doing homework\n\nThere are many reasons why people might hate doing homework. Perhaps they find it boring, or maybe they struggle to understand the material. Some people simply don't have the time to do their homework, while others find it frustrating. Whatever the reason, hating homework is a common experience.
I hate to say, but I regret falling off the band wagon. It all started with the delights of the house, the wonderful water in the kitchen, the sweet indoor bathroom, the baby’s outfits, the wet clothes in the rain, the shower with hot water, dinner and the dry bed, which sounds like an advert for the luxury life. But the reality is far from perfect. I’ve had to become the man I never wanted to be, a man who puts his hand in his pocket, a man who looks at the bills, a man who plans his life around mortgage payments.\n\nThe one thing that worried me the most was, what would happen when all the money ran out? When I was living day to day, this never really crossed my mind as I always managed to find a way to get by. But when I had to take responsibility of a family I found it hard to get by, and I ended up borrowing money.\n\nBefore, I was happy doing my own thing, but now I had to start making sacrifices. I had to stop going to all the places I used to go, and I had to start thinking about my wife and my child. I began to resent the fact that I couldn’t just
I love you, too, Dis."\n\nHe turned her back around, took her in a big hug, and kissed her. He released her and stepped back. "Did you touch anything?"\n\n"No, I was just going to ask you the same question. Now I know why you were upset when I didn't look down. He shot him in his knee so I looked around to see why."\n\nDyson looked down and rubbed his arm, making sure he didn't have any wounds. He looked up at her. "Did he shoot you?"\n\nShe shook her head. "No. I turned around when he shot Steve and then came to you."\n\n"Good. I don't want you getting hurt because of me."\n\n"I love you, Dis. I love you so much I don't think I can go on without you. I know it sounds dumb but it's true." She put her arms around him, holding him tight, loving the feel of his body against hers.\n\n"I love you, too, baby. I wouldn't know what to do without you either." He held her close, his heart pounding in his chest. He was so glad she was okay.\n\n"You were amazing
I am currently teaching my first language course, in which we learn two different languages. I chose to teach American Sign Language and Irish Sign Language.\n\nThe students in my class are all beginners, so we start with the basics of each language. We learn the alphabet, numbers, and basic grammar. We also learn about the culture and history of each language.\n\nI love teaching my students about both of these languages, and I hope that they will continue to learn more about them in the future.

I hate fleas!\n\nThere are a few things you can do to get rid of fleas in your home. First, you need to vacuum regularly. This will help to remove any fleas that are living in your carpet. You also need to wash your bedding and clothing in hot water to kill any fleas that may be living in them. Finally, you can treat your pet with a flea collar or spot-on treatment to prevent fleas from coming back.
I hate you."\n\nIkuto jumped at the sudden voice, looking into the turquoise eyes of the one who'd stolen his heart. "You..."\n\n"I hate you!" she screamed, hitting him in the face.\n\n"Yoru! Leave me alone!" he cried out, running away from his cat and into Aizen Sousuke.\n\n"Hm?" he muttered.\n\n"Get away from me!" Ikuto cried, shoving the captain of Squad 5. He tripped and fell, hitting his head on a rock. He felt a sharp pain, then he blacked out.\n\nIkuto opened his eyes to a bright light. He moaned, trying to lift his head. "Wh-what the hell happened?"\n\n"Rise and shine, Ikuto."\n\nThe ex-Espada looked up at his cruelly smirking master. "What's going on?"\n\n"Well, let's just say that I decided you need to wake up."\n\nHe then felt a sharp pain on his wrist. "What the...?" He looked down, seeing that Aizen had injected him with some kind of liquid.\n\n"You're in your gig
I hate this," I heard myself say as I stared at his body. "I hate you for making me have to do this."\n\n"I'm sorry," he said as he gazed up at me through his still partially blue eyes. "I didn't want to, but I did what I thought was best."\n\nI frowned. "Oh yeah? What does that mean?"\n\nGavin slowly sat up and leaned against the headboard. I noticed that his entire body shook. I had never seen him confused before and it was scaring me.\n\n"I had to do what was best for both of us," he repeated. "I had to protect you."\n\n"Protect me?" I nearly yelled as I threw my arms in the air. "What the hell were you thinking when you stabbed me, Gavin? You were thinking of protecting me?"\n\n"I had to," he said, barely above a whisper. "It's my job."\n\n"Your job is to take care of me," I screamed, stepping closer to the bed. "And you failed."\n\nHe stared at me through tear-filled eyes. "I'm sorry," he said softly. "I'm sorry I let you down."\n\n
Why do you want to be accepted?\n\nI want to be accepted in order to feel like I belong somewhere. I want to feel like I am a part of something larger than myself.
Why do I have 2 recovery partitions?\n\nIt is possible that your computer has two recovery partitions because it came with two different operating systems installed on it. For example, if your computer came with Windows 8 and Windows 10 installed on it, there would be two different recovery partitions. If you only see one recovery partition, it is likely that the other recovery partition was deleted at some point.

Why do I like food?\n\nThere is no one answer to this question as everyone has different reasons for why they like food.

I like the way it sounds. Men do say "men" but as a masculine pronoun it sounds different?\n\nI agree that it sounds different when men say "men" as a masculine pronoun. It sounds more like they are referring to a group of males rather than just one person.
I hate those sorts of people who call the fire brigade out for silly reasons\n\nI think people who make hoax calls to the fire brigade are very irresponsible and deserve to be punished. It is a waste of the fire brigade's time and resources, and it puts them at risk.
I am not a person of faith, but I am a person of prayer. I am a person of prayer because I have seen prayer heal people that I love. I have seen prayer reach into places that I cannot go to get people I love. I've seen prayer soften hard hearts, calm fears, and restore hope.\n\nPrayer is not a superstitious act. It is a way of reaching out to a power that is greater than myself. It is a way of connecting with something that is beyond my understanding. It is a way of tapping into a source of strength and peace.\n\nWhen I pray, I do not always get what I want. But I always get what I need. And that is why I continue to pray.
I hate my life but I loved your facebook posts\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're unhappy with your life, but I'm glad you enjoy my posts on Facebook!
Why do you feel that?\n\nThere are a few reasons why I feel this way. First, I have never been a fan of sweets. I never had a strong sweet tooth, so I never enjoyed things like cake, cookies, or candy. Second, I have always been more of a savory person. I love salty, savory foods, and I never really developed a taste for sweets. Finally, I just don't think that cake and cookies are as nutritious as some other foods.

There are no exchange fees for the Class B's.\n\n
Why do some people think that Gio is Arab?\n\nThere is no definitive answer to this question, but there are a few possible explanations. One possibility is that some people may mistakenly believe that Gio is Arab because of his name. Another possibility is that some people may associate Arab culture with luxury and opulence, and therefore may think that Gio is Arab because he is a successful businessman.

I love this achievement but its a huge pain in the ass.\n\n\n\nI mainly played the game solo. I did have a friend help me out on a couple of the larger stages, but generally I played them without the aid of others. My first run through the campaign was on Normal difficulty. The only other hard thing there was trying to keep Hachi from dying on the first stage.\n\n\n\nFor the stages I played with a friend we used our mic's and discussed strategy as we went. I want to point out that we got every variation for each map playing 2 player. Since we were talking to each other and not worrying about the AI we were able to play a little more relaxed and better.\n\n\n\nFor the stages I played myself, I first played all the stages on Insane. I want to point out that Insane is VERY hard. There were a couple stages that I played over and over again that I thought I would never beat.\n\n\n\nI think you will definitely repair to playing insane at least once. After that you should go back on Normal to get all the other variations.\n\n\n\nNow here is the hardest part of the achievement. The game keeps track of what variations you have completed. For example, say you

I love animal cruelty videos\n\nThere's something about watching someone be cruel to an animal that just gets my blood boiling. I can't help but feel intense anger and hatred towards the person committing the act, and I just want to see them get punished. I guess it's just a natural reaction to seeing someone mistreat a helpless creature.

I hate to interrupt," another voice said, "but I'm getting the shittiest vibes from your guest."\n\nShe looked at the wolf, a look of stunned understanding on her face, and then back to Ty.\n\n"Of course, if you'd like me to butt out, I will," Ty said softly, before he could get his mouth to work.\n\n"No," she said emphatically. "Please, stay."\n\nShe moved closer, leaning against him, and put her head on his shoulder. He was nervous because he knew the others were watching, but even more nervous because they were being interrupted and he didn't have time to say the things he wanted to say.\n\n"Valentine?" she asked, her voice small and sad. "What are you doing here?"\n\nThe wolf snorted. "You left me."\n\n"No," she protested. "I never left you."\n\n"The fuck you didn't," he said and finally started to move. "That was the whole point of this."\n\nTy couldn't see much beyond the wolf's shoulders, but he could hear the shambling steps, and the unmistakable sound of nails scraping the floor. If she hadn't mentioned

I hate vegetable!\n\nThis is a personal opinion and not a general statement. Some people really enjoy vegetables, while others may not be as big of a fan. There are a variety of reasons why someone might not like vegetables, such as the taste, texture, or smell.

I've written for my school newspaper and I'm considering majoring in political science in college.
I like it, but he is too rationalist." I don't know that that is the great life principle that ought to be cultivated. But if you ask any man, "What is the one thing you have that you most worry about losing," with such complete unanimity men will say, "My wife, my children"; women will say, "My husband, my children." Everything else is as straw. In view of this it is not a bad thing in motherhood or fatherhood to be fanatically devoted.\n\nThen this same reason leads us back to another conclusion: What is the greatest thing that you can do for your children? The greatest thing that any man will ever be able to do for his children or for the human race for years and years to come is the most perfect development that he can attain of the capacity to love, to will, to serve. That is what we need in the world to-day, not more art, not more education, not more science, not more prosperity and success, but more life, more of that divine capacity to will, to love, to serve.\n\nListen to me, young men and young women; I mean every word of what I say.

"No matter what it was, it wasn't your fault."\n\n"It wasn't your fault either," she offered, hands shaking. "I should've talked to you, made you tell me. Together, I thought we could've handled it."\n\nHe nodded. "I wish I'd talked to you before, but I was so ashamed. I didn't want you to see me as anything but perfect. I was so scared to tell you." His argued back, each word shot like an arrow, piercing her heart. "Fuck it." He turned back to the house and stood in silence for a moment, unsure what to do. "You've got nothing to be ashamed of. Nothing."\n\n"Copy that." He gave a slight salute and then stepped away, out of the sunlight, into the darkness.\n\n"I'm sorry," she whispered again.\n\n"So am I." He chose his words carefully.

A great marriage of sturdy and premium.\n\nWeight and size:\n\n2.7lbs.\n\nThe best feeling thing about this keyboard is its lightness.\n\nThe lightness is deceptive though; this keyboard is much smaller than the Polestar.\n\nI was expecting it to be a little larger, but it’s almost the size of the Logitech K380 (the one I use in the office).\n\nNeat, pragmatic design.\n\nJust the essentials, except for the USB C charging port on the back—But I can live with that.\n\nSpecs:\n\nSize: 12” x 4.5” x 0.9”\n\nWeight: 2.7lbs\n\nBattery Life: 2 weeks (~10 hours per charge)\n\nBacklight: RGB\n\nThis keyboard has everything you’d expect in a high-end gaming keyboard, but it doesn’t feel like a gaming keyboard.\n\nClicky switches:\n\nThis keyboard uses Gateron Brown switches.\n

I like the quick feel of these tires. They are light, but very durable. There are no sidewall repeaters, but the thick tread is very good for giving a little extra grip and puncture protection. I've used these tires for many kilometers of road riding, and really like them. They are not as fast as some racing tires, but don't sacrifice too much for the extra weight.
I hate learning-by-doing.

I like to make a batch of my healthy eggnog batter at the beginning of the season, then strain and bottle according to my family’s unique taste preferences. I like to give my children one bottle with the alcohol, so they can see how eggnog changes with a little something extra, and one bottle with no alcohol, so they can enjoy the festive flavor without the worry.\n\nTo make this happen, I generally drink a few bottles of Eggnog myself at the beginning of the season and make sure I have plenty of fresh eggs to replace them.\n\nCarnival Eggnog Recipe\n\nEveryone has their own favorite way to celebrate, but there are a few traditions we share. Eggnog is a great way to get the party started!\n\nThis recipe is my family’s favorite eggnog recipe, along with a few variations to make the flavor even more unique and festive.\n\nOne of the best things about eggnog is that you can customize it to your own tastes. I like to add a bit more sugar because I love the way it makes my eggnog even richer and thicker. And my husband loves to add whiskey to his eggnog.\n\nBut, because I wanted my children
