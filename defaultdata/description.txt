Why do you think it is that there is such a conflict between the people who want freedom from a dictatorship and the people who want freedom from religion?\n\nThere is a conflict between the people who want freedom from a dictatorship and the people who want freedom from religion because they are two different things. People who want freedom from a dictatorship want to be able to live their lives without someone telling them what to do, while people who want freedom from religion want to be able to believe in whatever they want without someone telling them what to believe.
I love making costumes but they are never original I would love to have some originality to them.\n\nThere are a few ways that you can make your costumes more original. One way is to choose a unique character or style that you want to portray. Another way is to create your own spin on a classic costume. You can also try incorporating elements from your own personal style into your costume. Whatever you do, make sure that your costume expresses your own personality and style.
I hate slow drivers\n\nI hate when people drive slow in the left lane. It's so annoying!
I am sorry to hear that she is not doing well\n\nWe are sorry to hear that she is not doing well.
I hate this\n\nI hate the way you make me feel\n\nI hate that you make me feel at all\n\nI hate that I can't get over you\n\nI hate that you're still in my head\n\nI hate that you're still in my heart\n\nI hate that you're still in my life\n\nI hate that I can't let you go\n\nI hate that I still love you\n\nI hate that you don't love me back\n\nI hate that I can't move on\n\nI hate that you're still my everything.
Why do the rich and powerful always see the poor and the powerless as the ones profiting from a system that needs to be changed, but the rich and powerful by their own admission are the ones who profit most?"\n\n\n\nThere are a number of reasons for this. First, the rich and powerful have a vested interest in maintaining their position of power and privilege. They want to keep the status quo because it benefits them. Second, they are often ignorant of or indifferent to the plight of the poor and the powerless. They don't see how the system is rigged against them and they don't care. Finally, the rich and powerful are often able to use their influence and resources to control the narrative and blame the poor and the powerless for the problems of society.
I love you.\n\n-I love you too.
Why do you want to be an Au Pair?\n\nI want to be an au pair because I want to experience living in a different country and culture and I want to help a family by taking care of their children.
I like the idea and implications of this—I want to find a way to make my own, or to encourage/help my students to play with, film transcripts in a similar fashion to how Yanyu Chen has worked with her interviews.\n\nI also like the idea that Chen has challenged the authenticity of the interview and interviewee through the transcribing and slighting changes Chen makes to the “official” transcription.\n\nChen’s work is also a great example of how the use of the subtitle track in YouTube can be used in a much more dynamic way than just translation or the “hard of hearing.” Here it serves as an extension of the visual image on the screen.
Why do you think the author chose not to reveal the murderer’s identity until the end of the story?\n\nThe author choose not to reveal the murderer's identity until the end of the story because it is a mystery novel.
Why do we crawl when we are babies and run when we are adult?\n\nWe crawl when we are babies because it is the easiest way to move around. We run when we are adults because it is the fastest way to move around.
I love it when people ask me things like, “What was one of your favorite classes?” or “What do you wish you had taken more classes in?”\n\nMy answer is almost always the same.\n\n“I wish I had taken more classes in art.”\n\nIt’s so true. I always loved art, but I never took advantage of the art classes that were available to me.\n\nAs an English major, I took a lot of classes that I enjoyed, but I wish I had taken more classes in art. I would have loved to learn more about painting, drawing, and sculpture.\n\nSadly, I never took advantage of the opportunity to take art classes. I wish I had taken more classes in art, but I’m glad I took the classes I did.
I am hyperactive\n\n\nI am always moving around and can't sit still for very long. I have trouble concentrating on one task for more than a few minutes. I am easily bored and often interrupt others when they are talking.
I love the simple, modern aesthetics of this.
Why do we change the way we count when a new year begins?\n\nThe way we count changes because it is a new year, and we want to start over.
I like to get tanked every now and again\n\nI like to drink alcohol occasionally.
Why do I need an X-Ray?\n\nYour doctor may order an X-ray if you have certain symptoms that could be caused by a problem with your bones or joints. These symptoms might include pain, swelling, or deformity. An X-ray can help your doctor find the cause of your symptoms and determine the best way to treat it.
I love love love this Realtor! She is so supportive of all her clients for any and all steps in the housing market. She is very detail oriented, and because of that everything runs smoothly and quickly! I have used her for multiple transactions already and continue to call on her for each and every housing market transition! If anyone is looking for an agent in the entire state of Texas, she is the one to call and use!\n\nI have had an amazing experience from start to finish with Melissa Faircloth. I worked with Melissa on finding my first home. She answered all of my questions and educated me about the home buying process. She worked hard to help me find the perfect home for my family. She always responded promptly to my calls and texts and continued to stay in touch even after we closed. I would highly recommend Melissa to anyone looking to buy or sell their home!\n\nMelissa was amazing throughout my house hunt in San Antonio. My needs were constantly changing and she always made the considerable effort to understand them. She was always on top of follow ups on listings and often beat other realtors thousands of dollars over. I look forward to continuing to work with her going forward.\n\nWe found our dream house because of Melissa!
I love that ever since you started writing about the work you've done, people have come forward and shared their stories, like the one about the father and son who recently reconnected and the one about the wife who survived the husband's murder.\n\nI think people are more comfortable sharing their stories with me because I write a blog, and they don't feel like I'm really reporting on them. A lot of people feel like they need to tell their stories, and they don't necessarily want to go to the media to do it.\n\nWhat's been the biggest challenge you've faced so far as a reporter?\n\nThe biggest challenge I've faced is the emotional toll it can take. It's hard to see people going through so much hardship, and it can be hard to keep going when you feel like you can never make a real difference.\n\nWhat advice would you give other aspiring reporters?\n\nThe best advice I can give is to keep going. Don't be discouraged if you don't get the story you want right away, or if you don't get the recognition you feel you deserve.\n\nKeep writing, keep learning, and keep fighting for the stories that need to be told.
I hate being pregnant\n\nThere are a lot of things that can be difficult about pregnancy, from the physical discomfort to the emotional ups and downs. Some women find pregnancy to be a wonderful time, while others find it to be a difficult and trying time. If you're feeling negative about your pregnancy, it's important to talk to your doctor or a counselor to get help dealing with your feelings.
I am a Table tennis player.
Why do something you are not sure is going to work?
I hate to talk about your weight...\n\n...but you could stand to lose a few pounds.
I like being at home\n\nThere are many things that I like about being at home. I like that I can be comfortable and relax in my own space. I also like that I can do what I want, when I want. I don't have to worry about following someone else's rules or schedules. I can eat what I want, watch what I want, and go to bed when I want. Being at home is also a great way to save money. I don't have to spend money on things like gas or food when I'm at home.
I love travelling! I got to see different parts of the world, meet new people and try different things.\n\nWhat is the best trip you’ve ever been on?\n\nMy favourite trip was to the Philippines. I loved the beaches, the jungle and the people.
I am not a big fan of tennis players in general.\n\nThis is largely due to the fact that I am not a big fan of tennis itself. I find the sport to be incredibly boring, and the players often seem arrogant and unappealing.
I am thinking 25%\n\nThis is a difficult question to answer. It depends on how much debt the company has, what their interest rates are, and a number of other factors.
I like to write and I like to read\n\nI like to write because it is a way for me to express myself. I like to read because it is a way for me to learn new things.
Why do you take time to smell roses?\n\nRoses have a pleasant smell, and taking time to smell them can be a way to relax and enjoy the moment.
I love the smell of burning tires because it electricizes me and makes me feel like I'm doing something exciting.
I like the way you make it sound like it's all my idea."\n\n"It is." She let out a grinding noise. "Why is it hard to say I love you out loud?"\n\n"I don't know." He wrapped an arm around her and pulled her close. His eyes were hard on her. "I love you, Eve."\n\n"I love you too." She felt herself blush, and she pressed her lips to his. "I don't know how to make it sound better, but I love you."\n\n"That's all that matters." He kissed her again. "That's all that ever mattered."\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 25\n\n\nEve\n\n\n\n\n\nEve was pulled from sleep by the sound of voices in the other room. She blinked her eyes open and looked at the clock on her bedside table. It was seven in the morning.\n\nShe sat up and tried to listen to the voices, but she couldn't make out what they were saying. It sounded like Grace and Luke, but that couldn't be right. Grace and Luke weren't supposed to be back from their honeymoon for another week.\n\nEve pulled the covers off of her and got out of bed.
Why do we need to measure\n\nThere are many reasons why measurement is important. For example, measurement is essential in order to:\n\n-Compare things (e.g. to see which is larger, heavier, etc.)\n\n-Estimate quantities (e.g. how much paint is needed to cover a wall)\n\n-Determine the properties of things (e.g. the density of a material)\n\n-Perform calculations (e.g. to work out the area of a room)\n\n-Communicate information (e.g. giving someone your height in centimetres).
I hate the entire crew, including you\n\nI hate the entire crew, including you\n\nYou're all a bunch of idiots, and I hate you all!
I love everything about working at the co-op! I am passionate about our mission, and the people I work with. I've learned about so much great local food and products, and enjoy working with our community & members.\n\nWhat does local mean to you?\n\nI was born and raised in South Dakota, and have lived in Wisconsin for 4 years. When I think about "local" I think about the food I grew up with and the farmers I knew. I also think about the people in our community, who are winemakers, cheese makers, & farmers. Local is about building relationships with people who are working to make their communities a better place.
I like having a little more control over what I'm doing. I think it means more to me when it's completely mine."\n\n"Can you still work with people? Collaborate?"\n\n"Of course. But it's different. It's like I'm in control and they're reacting to what I want. It's not always the same, but it's what works for me."\n\n"I see."\n\nWe were both silent for a moment and I could tell he was thinking about what I'd said. "It makes sense, actually. I can see how that would work for you."\n\n"Good."\n\n"Is there anything else you want to tell me?"\n\nI shook my head. "No, I think that's it."\n\n"Okay." He stood up and held out his hand to me. "Thank you for your honesty."\n\nI shook his hand and then followed him out of the room.\n\nI was in my office, working on a new project, when my assistant came in.\n\n"Mr. Stone is here to see you," she said.\n\nI frowned. I wasn't expecting him. "Okay, send him in."
I hate the way my father and my grandfather subscribe to the 1950s philosophy on gender roles: men wear the pants in the family and are the primary breadwinners while women wear skirts and take care of the children.\n\nI grew up in a family where my father and grandfather subscribed to the 1950s philosophy on gender roles: men wore the pants in the family and were the primary breadwinners while women wore skirts and took care of the children. I often felt like I was living in a time warp where women's rights and equality were concerned. As an adult, I've made a conscious effort to create a more balanced and egalitarian relationship with my husband.
I like it too," Imogen said. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, and Francis knew she was trying to avoid his eyes. "The armchair has great bones," she said, "and with a few repairs, it will look great."\n\n"I like your confidence," he said.\n\n"I like your armchair."\n\n"Well, it really looks like a great piece. Have you checked the upholstery yet?"\n\nImogen nodded. "It's well-made," she said. "The fabric is worn and faded, but it's original and it's structurally sound."\n\n"Excellent."\n\n"It's a great piece," she said. "I'm excited to work on it."\n\n"And you're a great upholsterer," he said. "I'm excited to see what you'll do with it."\n\nThey looked at each other, and Francis was about to say something when his phone rang. He checked the caller ID, but didn't recognize the number.\n\n"Sorry," he said, "I have to get this."\n\n"No problem."\n\nHe answered the phone and put it to his ear. "What's up?".
I love you” as a declaration if you want to say it. But, store it in your heart as a prayer, an attitude, a wish, an intention. Unless you say it in the context of a free exchange in which the other person is free to respond or not respond, it’s an accusation instead.\n\n“I love you,” I tell my wife, although she didn’t ask for it. Seems a little presumptuous and a lot of pressure, doesn’t it? Of course, if her innate need for love and affirmation is greater than that, maybe it would be better just not to say anything at all.\n\nIf you genuinely love others without expecting any reply, then they will naturally respond. And you are moving them towards their wholeness. People can never live up to our expectations. We often end up feeling disappointed, betrayed and angry at them. And all the time the person feels inadequate and unworthy, greatly exacerbating the need that you were trying to address with your declaration in the first place.\n\nOur motivations are informed by our values. In a world where money and possessions are extremely valued and in fairly short supply, it’s natural to feel selfish and protective.
Why do you never use the word\n\nI don't know.
I like the natural pattern of the wood more than the finish itself," said Linsey, looking around her own dining room with its medley of built-ins.\n\n\n\nWood grain patterns are not the only aspect of "natural finishing," however. Gilding is still widely used and can look just as natural and well-integrated into the design as stain.\n\n\n\n"It really depends on the style you want to accomplish with the space," said Linsey. "Gilding can be done to give the illusion of material that's much more expensive than it actually is. I've seen weathered wood stained to look like it's an antique."\n\n\n\nGilding is used to add dimension and highlight architectural details such as molding, doorways and mantels. In fact, Linsey is currently having the back piece to a fireplace in one of the houses she is restoring gilded for this exact reason.\n\n\n\n"We had the back piece cleaned, so it's now all the same golden color, but we wanted it to stand out from the rest of the fireplace," said Linsey. "It also just looks really pretty."
I like that we're able to have a general conversation about everyday life as well as talk about any issues we may have.
I am pleased to welcome two new members to our board of trustees, John Nantz and Bill Gronemeyer. John and Bill bring a wealth of experience to our work and their leadership will be very valuable in charting a strategic course forward for our work on behalf of the people of Minnesota.”\n\nJohn Nantz, a retired lumber company executive from Duluth, and Bill Gronemeyer, a retired businessman from Mankato, both have experience serving on the boards of nonprofits.\n\nNantz has served on the board of Duluth Seaway Port Authority for more than 30 years and is past president and chair. He is a former member of the boards of Duluth-Superior Area Community Foundation and Duluth Huskies Baseball.\n\nGronemeyer has served as chair, president and executive committee member on the board of Maxfield Public Library, Mankato. He has also served on the boards of Blue Earth County Housing and Redevelopment Authority, and Blue Earth County Economic Development Authority. Gronemeyer has also served in multiple leadership positions on the board of the Mankato Arts Council, including board president.
I love working with kids and enjoy teaching them new things. I also like the challenge of working in a fast-paced environment.
I love it.\n\nEverytime I go to the store this is what I'll buy from now on.\n\nNo more Andes mints for me.
I am not 100% positive, but I think the verb "to tell" should be used with the subject in the 1st person singular here.\nIn general, the verb "to tell" wouldn't have a negative connotation if the subject is "I", even if the subject matter were sensitive or embarrassing.  If, however, a person were to tell others about his/her sensitive or embarrassing experiences, then the person may be perceived as bragging or gossiping.\nAnother consideration, which may be more important, is that this sentence seems to imply "I am not telling anyone" (at least, that's my interpretation).  The speaker may actually be telling some people and not others and the speaker sees this as an insignificant distinction.
Why do you want me to come with you?"\n\nBecause I don't want to go alone.
I like the smell of Bible Stories.\n\nI like the smell of my grandma's house.\n\nI like the smell of fresh laundry.
I hate shopping\n\nI hate having to shop for clothes. It's so time-consuming and frustrating. I would much rather just buy something online without having to try it on.
I love you, my little Fargit, with all my heart.'\n\nFargit hurried forward, taking her in his arms and embracing her tightly. 'I love you too,' he told her. 'You are the best mother anyone could have.'\n\n'And what of you?' the Queen asked, gently pushing him away from her, a concerned look on her face. 'You have changed, my son. I can sense it in you. You are tired, sad and angry, and I can tell you are hiding something from me.'\n\n'It is nothing, Mother, I assure you. I am merely tired, and angry at the way my life has turned out.'\n\n'Turned out?' The Queen was confused. 'Whatever do you mean? You are the ruler of the Fargits, and shall be King when I no longer rule.'\n\n'Yes, Mother, I know.' Fargit sighed. 'But if you knew what I went through on my travels, you might not be so quick to hand the crown to me. My time as a Captain in the Auvergne Army changed me, it really did. I saw death and violence which I would never have thought possible.
I hate to be a d**k...\n\nbut I'm not going to answer this question.
I like to go to a movie, out to dinner and maybe dancing\n\nI like all kinds of movies, going out to dinner, maybe some dancing.
I am not very good at the maths.\n\nI am not very good at math.
Why do you think Jules asked to visit with Miss Papa?\n\nThere could be many reasons why Jules asked to visit with Miss Papa. Perhaps she feels comfortable with Miss Papa and enjoys spending time with her. Additionally, Miss Papa may be able to provide Jules with advice or guidance.
I hate you.\n\nYou're horrible.
I like people a lot,” Kravitz said. “I played a lot of places with a lot of people. I’ve matured a lot over the years. I don’t take any of this too seriously. It’s rock and roll, it’s supposed to be fun. I enjoy playing with people who enjoy playing. I’ve met some great musicians. I’ve tried to surround myself with good musicians throughout the years.”\n\nHe added: “I’m just a musical person. I’ve been doing it all my life and I plan to do it for the rest of my life. It’s just a part of me.”\n\nBut looking back, Kravitz is not sure it would have happened the same way if he was from this generation.\n\n“With social media it’s different,” he said. “I started out around the time the Internet was just coming in. I was the old school, a guy from a different era. The era of the Internet is different. I think people feel a little entitled these days and you have to stay current.
I hate this book\n\nI hate this book. It is so boring.
I love it because you can put even the fattest tires in it and they fit beautifully. :thumbsup:\n\n\n\nDon't miss the bike you want in the white color.\n\n\n\nP.S. I would buy a new bike in this size without the disc brakes but I'm daring like that. :D\n\n\n\nI actually had a white one that I bought and sold it cuz they didn't fit. Theoretically they should fit better than on a Klein Attitude cuz it's a hardtail with less travel. But I wasn't happy with it in that respect.\n\n\n\nI'll look at it, but I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to buy it till Thursday morning.
I like to think of the human body as a machine, with lots of different functioning parts. I like to think of osteoarthritis as a problem with one of those parts - in this case, the joints.\n\nThe joints are where two bones come together, and they are held together by a tough, fibrous tissue called cartilage. The cartilage acts as a buffer between the bones, absorbing shock and allowing the joints to move smoothly.\n\nOsteoarthritis is a condition in which the cartilage breaks down, and the bones start to rub together. This can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints.\n\nThere is no cure for osteoarthritis, but there are treatments that can help to relieve the symptoms. These include painkillers, anti-inflammatory drugs, and exercise.\n\nIn severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or replace the damaged joints.
I love my parents because they are always nice to me. They always put a smile on my face.
Why do exoplanets matter?\n\nExoplanets are important because they can help us to understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems. They can also tell us about the habitability of different types of planets and whether or not life could exist on them.
I am trained in both languages.\n\nIch bin in beiden Sprachen ausgebildet.
I am so proud of her!”\n\nThe tone from those who follow and comment on Sarah’s blog has gone from that of an ostracized, rebellious kid to one of acceptance and support. Her peers, who might be the closest thing she has to family, applaud her for speaking out. Sarah has found a way to tap into a supportive network of her peers who are united by a shared experience of being isolated and misunderstood, both in and out of their home.\n\nQuestions and Observation\n\nSometimes we see youth rebel. We see them when they dress differently, down to their look, the music they listen to and the music they write. We see them when they use words we don’t understand. We see them when they speak their minds, write their truth and show their feelings and pain. Sometimes our response is to ostracize, ignore, dismiss and dismiss them.\n\nWhen we react in panic to youth behavior, we tend to blame anything and everything we can think of, ourselves included. When we blame ourselves and don’t know how to help, we end up passing the buck to any person or institution that “should” be helping them. I’ve seen it happen too many times.
I am being curt, I know; and most importantly, don’t be afraid to ask questions, whether it’s to the writers, or to the sites you read. If there’s something you don’t know, or think your knowledge isn’t up to par, then ask! Not only will the writers be okay with it, but I find that most readers are in the dark about a lot, and will benefit from hopping on your train and giving you both a helping hand.\n\nWhat should I feel bad about?\n\nYou should feel bad about writing, about the work you pour into something you love, about being honest with your audience and not catering to the mob, about being forced to give up something you love, about the environment you were born and raised into, about the people you care about, about being in this situation in the first place.\n\nYou should feel bad about finding yourself in a position you never asked to be in, and you should feel bad about being pushed around by people who claim to love and care about you, when all they really want is for you to shut up and do what they say.\n\nYou should feel bad, but don’t.
I hate doing homework\n\nThere are many reasons why people might hate doing homework. Perhaps they find it boring, or maybe they struggle to understand the material. Some people simply don't have the time to do their homework, while others find it frustrating. Whatever the reason, hating homework is a common experience.
I hate to say, but I regret falling off the band wagon. It all started with the delights of the house, the wonderful water in the kitchen, the sweet indoor bathroom, the baby’s outfits, the wet clothes in the rain, the shower with hot water, dinner and the dry bed, which sounds like an advert for the luxury life. But the reality is far from perfect. I’ve had to become the man I never wanted to be, a man who puts his hand in his pocket, a man who looks at the bills, a man who plans his life around mortgage payments.\n\nThe one thing that worried me the most was, what would happen when all the money ran out? When I was living day to day, this never really crossed my mind as I always managed to find a way to get by. But when I had to take responsibility of a family I found it hard to get by, and I ended up borrowing money.\n\nBefore, I was happy doing my own thing, but now I had to start making sacrifices. I had to stop going to all the places I used to go, and I had to start thinking about my wife and my child.
I am currently teaching my first language course, in which we learn two different languages. I chose to teach American Sign Language and Irish Sign Language.\n\nThe students in my class are all beginners, so we start with the basics of each language. We learn the alphabet, numbers, and basic grammar. We also learn about the culture and history of each language.\n\nI love teaching my students about both of these languages, and I hope that they will continue to learn more about them in the future.
I love this fried rice recipe! It’s perfect for $35 or less!\n\nIngredients:\n\n4 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\n4 eggs, lightly beaten\n\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n\n4 cups cooked rice\n\n4 green onions, thinly sliced\n\n1/4 cup soy sauce\n\n1/4 cup chicken broth\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.

I am pleased to be with you today.\n\nThank you for inviting me.
I hate fleas!\n\nThere are a few things you can do to get rid of fleas in your home. First, you need to vacuum regularly. This will help to remove any fleas that are living in your carpet. You also need to wash your bedding and clothing in hot water to kill any fleas that may be living in them. Finally, you can treat your pet with a flea collar or spot-on treatment to prevent fleas from coming back.
I hate you."\n\nIkuto jumped at the sudden voice, looking into the turquoise eyes of the one who'd stolen his heart. "You..."\n\n"I hate you!" she screamed, hitting him in the face.\n\n"Yoru! Leave me alone!" he cried out, running away from his cat and into Aizen Sousuke.\n\n"Hm?" he muttered.\n\n"Get away from me!" Ikuto cried, shoving the captain of Squad 5. He tripped and fell, hitting his head on a rock. He felt a sharp pain, then he blacked out.\n\nIkuto opened his eyes to a bright light. He moaned, trying to lift his head. "Wh-what the hell happened?"\n\n"Rise and shine, Ikuto."\n\nThe ex-Espada looked up at his cruelly smirking master. "What's going on?"\n\n"Well, let's just say that I decided you need to wake up."\n\nHe then felt a sharp pain on his wrist. "What the...?" He looked down, seeing that Aizen had injected him with some kind of liquid.
I hate this," I heard myself say as I stared at his body. "I hate you for making me have to do this."\n\n"I'm sorry," he said as he gazed up at me through his still partially blue eyes. "I didn't want to, but I did what I thought was best."\n\nI frowned. "Oh yeah? What does that mean?"\n\nGavin slowly sat up and leaned against the headboard. I noticed that his entire body shook. I had never seen him confused before and it was scaring me.\n\n"I had to do what was best for both of us," he repeated. "I had to protect you."\n\n"Protect me?" I nearly yelled as I threw my arms in the air. "What the hell were you thinking when you stabbed me, Gavin? You were thinking of protecting me?"\n\n"I had to," he said, barely above a whisper. "It's my job."\n\n"Your job is to take care of me," I screamed, stepping closer to the bed. "And you failed."\n\nHe stared at me through tear-filled eyes. "I'm sorry," he said softly. "I'm sorry I let you down."
Why do you want to be accepted?\n\nI want to be accepted in order to feel like I belong somewhere. I want to feel like I am a part of something larger than myself.
I hate that we have to wait a whole year to find out what happens next and what was in the box\n\nI know! The ending of the book is so frustrating because there are so many unanswered questions. I'm hoping that the sequel will provide some answers to what was in the box and what happens next.
I like to sleep\n\nI enjoy sleeping because it is a chance to rest and rejuvenate. When I sleep, I can forget about my troubles and relax. I also like sleeping because it gives me a chance to dream.
I hate the clouds,\n\nthe way they obscure the sun.\n\nI hate the rain,\n\nthe way it messes up my hair.\n\nI hate the snow,\n\nthe way it makes everything cold.\n\nBut most of all,\n\nI hate the way\n\nI can't seem to hate you.
Why do I like food?\n\nThere is no one answer to this question as everyone has different reasons for why they like food.

I like it, but he is too rationalist." I don't know that that is the great life principle that ought to be cultivated. But if you ask any man, "What is the one thing you have that you most worry about losing," with such complete unanimity men will say, "My wife, my children"; women will say, "My husband, my children."

That is what we need in the world to-day, not more art, not more education, not more science, not more prosperity and success, but more life, more of that divine capacity to will, to love, to serve.\n\nListen to me, young men and young women; I mean every word of what I say.
